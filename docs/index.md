# Welcome to eln2.org

Electrical Age 2.0, aka Eln2, is a new version of Electrical Age which is to be written for 1.12.

There are some major differences in the way that Eln2 will be set up, namely, the voltage tier system will be going away, and there will be much more flexibility in the operation of the grid networks.

Plans are for the mod to be at least to a playable Alpha state by Summer of 2020, with the work perhaps nearing completion by the end of 2020. These are rough guesses and are honestly pretty optimistic at best.
