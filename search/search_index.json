Week 3 (Jan 12 - Jan 18) Grissess works a lot on the MNA solver after jrddunbr tries to do some work but encounters some difficulty with configuring the datatypes efficiently. He also uses a similar methodology to the Falstad solver by having \"stamps\" that modify the matrix from the components. It's worth noting that the old MNA also had the concept of a stamp, and also had some matricies, but the names were a bit.. odd, and difficult to follow. jrddunbr writes a Falstad importer, which can ingest (basic) Falstad circuits and load them into the MNA for processing. Week 2 (Jan 5 - Jan 11) jrddunbr set up a Travis CI page to have a build test on our commits and PR's. Plans are to hopefully have a CD pipeline at some point. cam72cam got back to us about UMC, and we began working to determine how to make UMC generic enough that two completely different mods can use it. Quoting directly from cam72cam on the progress of UMC for newer versions: 1.14.4 still needs support for injecting or generating recipes. I need to work on that at some point or have you two [ jrddunbr and Grissess ] help I have no idea how any of the rendering will be able to be ported to 1.15.x jrddunbr set up the eln2.org website on GitHub Pages, after working with the DNS provider to determine why DNS was not propagating properly to some major resolvers. jrddunbr works on Kotlinizing the sim code Grissess works on figuring out the Gradle import code, turns out it's going to be more difficult than we thought. jrddunbr and Grissess work on determining how to use alternate MNA matrix math providers and make efficient wrappers around different math libraries for benchmarking. Week 1 (Jan 1 - Jan 4) Beginning of the revived Eln2 efforts. Developers are jrddunbr and Grissess On Jan 1, 2020, eln2.org was purchased. This allowed development using the org.eln2.* Java namespace to proceed without suddenly having the domain bought from under our feet. jrddunbr builds a new clean repo for eln2 dev, with just the old mods.eln.sim directory copied on top of a 1.12.2 Forge environment (refactored to org.eln2.sim ) and all Minecraft related methods (eg, NBT) deleted. Eln2 developers guide was created by jrddunbr cam72cam was contacted about Universal Mod Core UMC was selected because: It supports MC 1.12 It is actively developed and maintained It claims that it will support MC 1.14 and MC 1.15 in the near future, and has some decent work to show for it. Grissess and jrddunbr know the developer personally. Grissess worked for three days on figuring out why we were having Gradle issues with importing UMC, but was unable to determine a reliable solution.
